# PM2.5 Prediction System

## Introduction

This project aims to predict PM2.5 values using advanced machine learning techniques combined with mathematical equations. Built with Python and leveraging the PyCaret library, this system offers an efficient approach to model training and prediction, enabling accurate real-time air quality assessment.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Implement preprocessing steps to clean and prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Use PyCaret to train multiple machine learning models and select the best performer.
- **Prediction**: Apply mathematical equations to refine predictions and enhance accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations to display predicted vs actual PM2.5 values.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **PyCaret**: An open-source, low-code machine learning library used to prepare data and build models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical data operations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Installation of PyCaret and other dependencies
